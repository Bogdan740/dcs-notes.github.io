# Welcome to the CS130 revision guide

## [Full notes for the module](https://adrakaris.github.io/blog-cs/cs130/index.html)

The main set of notes for this module which is linked in the above heading were written **Yijun Hu**.

These are a link to an external website as opposed to internal markdown files, so *a pull request to convert them to be consistent with other notes would be appreciated* (`pandoc` offers reasonable initial conversion from HTML with MathJax to Markdown, but some additional tinkering is needed)

### Individual topics

Given the large number of topics, it makes sense to break these down into broader topics when revising - each of which having its own page. These are linked below by section:

1. [x] [Sets](https://adrakaris.github.io/blog-cs/cs130/index.html#sets)
2. [x] [Propositional logic](https://adrakaris.github.io/blog-cs/cs130/index.html#proplogic)
3. [x] [Logic of predicates](https://adrakaris.github.io/blog-cs/cs130/index.html#predicates)
4. [x] [Proofs](https://adrakaris.github.io/blog-cs/cs130/index.html#proofs)
5. [x] [Relations](https://adrakaris.github.io/blog-cs/cs130/index.html#relations)
6. [x] [Functions](https://adrakaris.github.io/blog-cs/cs130/index.html#functions)
7. [x] [Set Cardinality](https://adrakaris.github.io/blog-cs/cs130/index.html#cardinality)
8. [x] [Graphs](https://adrakaris.github.io/blog-cs/cs130/index.html#graphs)
9. [x] [Trees](https://adrakaris.github.io/blog-cs/cs130/index.html#trees)
10. [x] [Partial orders](https://adrakaris.github.io/blog-cs/cs130/index.html#partorder)
11. [x] [Probability](https://adrakaris.github.io/blog-cs/cs130/index.html#prob)

### Crib sheets

In addition to full notes, there is a condensed "crib sheet", which includes mostly includes definitions, so they don't need to just be rote learnt:

- [General crib sheet](./cribSheet.html)


Since the exam is held online this year (2021), questions are likely to be more proof than solution based, so a document on standard proof techniques is also likely to prove useful:

- [Proof approaches](./proofApproaches.html)



## Additional resources

### Flash Cards

**Anki** flash cards for the module by **Bora** [can be found here](https://github.com/bora-7/Anki-Flashcards-Year-1), simply download the CS130 deck and import it with Anki.

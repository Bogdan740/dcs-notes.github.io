## Greedy algorithms

### Strategies

#### 1."Greedy algorithm stays ahead"

After each step, show that the output of the greedy algorithm is at least as good as any other argument.

Example

#### 2. Structural

Find a structural property (called a bound) that all valid solutions must have, then show that the greedy algorithm always satisfies it.

Example

#### 3. Exchange argument

Gradually transform any solution to the one found by the greedy algorithm without hurting its quality.

Example

## Divide and conquer algorithms

### Master theorem

## Dynamic programming

## Intractability

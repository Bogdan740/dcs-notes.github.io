description: A collection of student made questions

# Introduction
One of the key complaints across many of the modules was the lack of practice questions, often one or two past papers and maybe a few worksheets, following on 
from the success of CSRG last year, I hope to allow the collective sharing of questions for the betterment of everyone involved.

The quiz section of this site operated on a collective set of questions organized into a JSON file, these can then be requested and displayed in a format determined by an end application, whether it be a list, flashcards, random questions or a past paper generator. I hope that a wide variety of such applications can me made to cater to everyone's revision needs.

Adding questions can be done by submitting a pull request to the github page [here](https://github.com/CSRG-Group/dcs-notes.github.io) please read the requirements and tutorial below.

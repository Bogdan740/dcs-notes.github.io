# Sequences and Series

## [Sequences](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/material/cs131/part3/note15.pdf)

- Definition
- convergent sequences
  - Combination rules
  - Properties
  - Basic examples
- Subsequences
- Divergent sequences
- Big-O

## [Recurrences](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/material/cs131/part3/note16.pdf)

- Linear recurrences
- Solving $$x_n + a \cdot x_{n-1} + b \cdot x_{n-2} = 0$$
  - Homogenous recurrences
  - Auxiliary equation
- Solving $$x_n + a \cdot x_{n-1} + b \cdot x_{n-2} = f(n)$$
  - Non-homogenous recurrences
  - general and particular solutions

# Welcome to the CS131 revision guide

## [Full notes for the module](./opnotes)

Detailed typed notes for CS131 by **Yijun Hu** which cover the entire module [can be found here](https://adrakaris.github.io/blog-cs/cs131/index.html),which is a link to an external site.

All of the content of the site has converted to markdown, and some very minor additions and changes were made by **Edmund Goodman** to form the main set of notes for the module which are linked in the above heading

### Individual topics

Given the large number of topics, it makes sense to break these down into broader topics when revising - each of which having its own page. These are linked below by section:

1. [x] [Number systems](part1)
2. [x] [Vectors](part2)
3. [x] [Matrices](part3)
4. [x] [Sequences and series](part4)
5. [x] [Calculus](part5)

### Crib sheets

On top of this, a crib sheet for question types has been made by **Akram Ahmad**, which [can be found here](RevisionQuestions)

Additionally, summary notes of key results, again made by the module organiser (not hosted here, and only accessible using a Warwick ITS account) are linked below:

## Complete Notes

Detailed typed notes for CS131 are in the process of being written, with the headings listed here, and being filled up over time. Since the provided notes by the module leader are so in depth, these will mostly just summarise key results.



*This should be a good place to start contributing if you want to begin making notes. The general intention here is essentially just making a list of key results and definitions, as the main notes in the online material provide very good coverage, along with examples*.
